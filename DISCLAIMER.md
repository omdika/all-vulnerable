   - Using this code in production systems will compromise security
   - This framework is for testing and education ONLY

2. **USE IN ISOLATED ENVIRONMENTS**
   - Run in isolated, controlled test environments
   - Do not connect to real networks or systems
   - Use virtual machines or containers with network isolation

3. **DO NOT EXPOSE TO THE INTERNET**
   - Never run this code on internet-accessible systems
   - Use localhost or isolated networks only
   - Assume all code can be exploited

4. **NO REAL CREDENTIALS**
